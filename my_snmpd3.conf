# SECTION: Agent Operating Mode
#
#   This section defines how the agent will operate when it
#   is running.

# agentaddress: The IP address and port number that the agent will listen on.
#   By default the agent listens to any and all traffic from any
#   interface on the default SNMP port (161).  This allows you to
#   specify which address, interface, transport type and port(s) that you
#   want the agent to listen on.  Multiple definitions of this token
#   are concatenated together (using ':'s).
#   arguments: [transport:]port[@interface/address],...

agentaddress  10.5.0.3:161

# SECTION: Monitor Various Aspects of the Running Host
#
#   The following check up on various aspects of a host.

# proc: Check for processes that should be running.
#     proc NAME [MAX=0] [MIN=0]
#   
#     NAME:  the name of the process to check for.  It must match
#            exactly (ie, http will not find httpd processes).
#     MAX:   the maximum number allowed to be running.  Defaults to 0.
#     MIN:   the minimum number to be running.  Defaults to 0.
#   
#   The results are reported in the prTable section of the UCD-SNMP-MIB tree
#   Special Case:  When the min and max numbers are both 0, it assumes
#   you want a max of infinity and a min of 1.
